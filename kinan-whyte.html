      <p class="intro">
        I value my personal growth and evolution in all fields of exploration.
        My strengths define how I connect to this value and other people. Gallup's <a href="http://www.strengthsfinder.com/home.aspx">StrengthsFinder</a> was founded on 50 years of researching human behavior. These are my strengths based on my assessment:

        <h3>Achiever</h3>
        <img src="images/achiever.png" alt="achiever-bow"/>
        <p>
          Being an achiever, I possess a great deal of stamina in working through projects. I have get an immense satisfaction in being busy and productive, love to complete tasks, and derive fulfillment from accomplishment. My strong inner drive is an innate source of intensity, energy, and power that enables me to often set the pace and define productivity levels for others around me.

      <article class="top-right-command" id="command">
        <h3>Command</h3>
        <img src="images/leader-crown.png" alt="leader-crown"/>
        <p>
          Having a command theme gives me a presence. I can take control of a situation and make decisions. Taking charge comes naturally. Seeing what needs to be done, I will speak up and am not frightened by confrontation; rather I understand that it is the first step to resolution. I may push to take risks, yet challenge others to be realistic and honest. I am willing to take a stand and lead.

        <h3>Ideation</h3>

        <p>
          I am fascinated by ideas. This enables me to find connections between seemingly disparate phenomena. I am creative and appreciate originality. Relishing in free-thinking experiences such as brainstorming and discussion groups, I have a natural capacity to consider issues from multiple perspectives. Thinking outside the box and viewing teh world upside down and inside out defines this forte.

      <article class="bottom-right-restorative" id="restorative">
        <h3>Restorative</h3>
        <img src="images/restorative.png" alt="restoration-icon"/>
        <p>
          A restorative skill-set means adeptness at dealing with problems. Being able to figure out what is wrong and resolve it is a perfect match for a role in medicine, consulting, computer programming, or customer service. I consistently have work in either one my entire working life. I love to solve problems and am energized by the advent of bringing something back to life or rekindling vitality.
