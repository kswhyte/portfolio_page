    <section class="intro">
      <p>
        I value my personal growth and evolution.
        My strengths define how I connect to this value and other people. Gallup's <a href="http://www.strengthsfinder.com/home.aspx" class="hyperlink">StrengthsFinder</a> was founded on 50 years of researching human behavior. These are my strengths based on my assessment:

          <img src="images/achiever.png" alt="achiever-bow"/>
            <p>
              Being an achiever, I possess a great deal of stamina in working through projects. I have get an immense satisfaction in being busy and productive, love to complete tasks, and derive fulfillment from accomplishment. My strong inner drive is an innate source of intensity, energy, and power that enables me to often set the pace and define productivity levels for others around me.

            <p>
              Having a command theme gives me a presence. I can take control of a situation and make decisions. Taking charge comes naturally. Seeing what needs to be done, I will speak up and am not frightened by confrontation; rather I understand that it is the first step to resolution. I may push to take risks, yet challenge others to be realistic and honest. I am willing to take a stand and lead.

            <p>
              I am fascinated by ideas. This enables me to find connections between seemingly disparate phenomena. I am creative and appreciate originality. Relishing in free-thinking experiences such as brainstorming and discussion groups, I have a natural capacity to consider issues from multiple perspectives. Thinking outside the box and viewing the world upside down and inside out defines this forte.

          <h3>Restorative</h3>
          <img src="images/restorative.png" alt="restoration-icon"/>
            <p>
              A restorative skill-set means adeptness at dealing with problems. Being able to figure out what is wrong and resolve it is a perfect match for a role in medicine, consulting, computer programming, or customer service. I consistently have work in either one my entire working life. I love to solve problems and am energized by the advent of bringing something back to life or rekindling vitality.

      <h2>Intention</h2>
        <h3 class="short-term">Short-term:</h3>
          <p class="short-term">
            My current intention is to learn the fundamentals of powerful emerging technologies. I wish to grasp the spectrum of available tools for building progressive web applications and software, by understanding recent improvements and implementations of Javascript. I love designing and building something beautiful from scratch. I revel in creative processes, especially within a team setting. Perhaps above all, I aim to enjoy what I do and do what I enjoy as much as possible with those who wish the same.

          <!-- <img class="reaching" src="images/hands-reaching-white.png" alt="hands-reaching"/> -->
          <br>
            I intend to learn as much as possible during my time at Turing School while developing professional skills in collaboration, pairing, interpersonal communication, organization, time management, project management, productivity/work flow, and leadership. Afterall, we chose to learn and continue building software and writing code for the sake of each other, for the sake of <em>people</em>, not computers. Turing is all about activating human potential, a vision close to my values.

          <p class="long-term">
            All too often humans can overlook the bigger picture of attaining fulfillment in all areas of life, not just a career. I definitely intend to lead a happy and adventurous life. Despite my professional goal to become an expert in developing software, communicating through multi-media, teaching, and consulting, I intend to raise the general level of satisfaction and quality experience of living day to day by creating and sustaining a deeply authentic relationship with self, others, and the very technology we build and use together.
