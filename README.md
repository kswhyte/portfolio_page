# Portfolio Page

A personal site represents you, your personal brand, and is a fantastic opportunity to make a great first impression. For this project, I focused on how to structure both my content and my HTML & CSS. It was important that my site have clear, easy to find content that provides a solid overview of my personality, my skills, and my background.

###This site was intended to be:

Easy to navigate
Clearly organized
Well written with reusable, DRY CSS and semantic HTML
Free of Bootstrap or other style guides â€“ write all your own HTML and CSS

###Content Hierarchy

I carefully considered how to organize my content and how I structured my site. I wanted to create a clear flow to the site.  I wanted my users to be able to focus on the code I have written, get an understanding of my personality, and have easy access to social media links. Clarity and usability are important. Simple and clear beats complex and confusing. This site aimed to be pleasant, logical, and easy to use.

###Technical Requirements:

Semantic HTML
DRY, reusable CSS
External stylesheets
Deploy as a gh-pages site
