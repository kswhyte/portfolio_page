      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <p>
        The following set of projects collectively exhibit my progression through Turing: School of Software and Design's Front-End Development program. In each project, I aimed to explore the front facing elements interactive software. As the program advanced, the meeting point of design and development became clearer, and skills at writing a blend of HTML, CSS, and Javascript began to bear fruits. From UX/UI principles to an expert understanding of the front-end toolkit, Turing has been essential to my evolution as a software developer and awareness of the critical part we play in modern engineering teams.

          <p>
            The goal of this app was to refine our craft in developing software--to not just stick to original assumptions, regardless of how much friction those decisions cause down the road. Another goal of this project is to push and test your ability to adapt your project as we learn new skills and topics over the course of the rest of the module. Planning, design, and overall user experience of the application are highlighted in this app. We chose to create a contactlist for users to house information of potential employers, clients, or whatever category of connections desired. Networking is a critical skill, and it can get hard to keep track of everyone you meet when you’re getting established in a new industry. We Built an app to help you organize all your contacts.

          <p>
            In this project we set out to build a chat-box style app in which users could shoot the breeze with each other from a sign-in with google accounts on Firebase. Within each users account, upon sign-in, they are able to save up to 100 messages and view a list of users that are present in the chat room. Users are also able to filter through messages by message content, username, and date/time. They can sort messages by new or old, and can also sort messages by clicking a user that is present on the user-list.

        <h3>Number Guesser in ReactJS</h3>
        <div><img class="number-guesser-react-image" src="./project-images/number-guesser-react.jpeg" alt="productivity picture"/></div>
          <p>
            Here, I re-built a small game based on the original NumberGuesser where the user picks a number between 1 and 100, this time using ReactJS and ES6. Upon entering the number, the application displays feedback indicating how close their guess was to a random number that was generated. After the guess is submitted, the 'max' and 'min' were increased and decreased respectively to add a greater difficulty after each successful guess. Users were also able to customize the range at their own volition. We worked on this project near the end of October, inspiring a Halloween theme.

        <h3>Seven Weeks of Fonts</h3>
        <div><img class="seven-weeks-of-fonts-image" src="./project-images/fonts.jpeg" alt="productivity picture"/></div>
          <p>
            Manipulating type in expressive, creative ways is an interesting CSS layout challenge, and developing the skill of choosing fonts that pair nicely together takes time. Drawing inspiration from the Yale School of Art’s 100 Days project, I built a new typographic experiment every week for my second module. The end deliverable is a one page site that shows the full collection of type exercises. To help build typography and layout skills simultaneously, I made my challenges revolve around working with pre-selected font pairings and text snippets. As the first 4 weeks were provided for, my job was to make a responsive and expressive layout using them. I asked myself the following questions: What feelings does the copy convey and how do I express that typographically? How can that be communicated through layout, scale, and color?

          <p>
            At the start to this project, we inherited someone’s previous ideaBox and pivoted it over to a '2DoBox'. In module 1, we focused on building an 'ideaBox' in which users could record and archive their ideas (good and bad alike). The idea behind 2DoList was to take the code base from one person's repository and pivot: Re-create this app with added features, this time with a spin that ideas are now to-do items on a list. We kept accessibility in mind here, as this project was largely graded on how accessible the users felt the UI was. We also implemented feature tests using selenium webdriver.

          <p>
            Our game is called Papaya Whipper, a new take on the classic Breakout arcade game. Its name carries on the legacy of building games as tributes to the finest Hex code colors, which began with Casey Metz and Jeff Duke's timeless classic, "Blanched Almonoid". To pay back our debt to these visionaries, there are hints of Blanched Almond throughout the games' styling. Papaya Whipper is built entirely with Javascript and HTML5 Canvas, was tested using Chai, and is our humble tribute to one of the most powerful colors humankind has ever created - Papaya Whip.

          <p>
            Every developer has more ideas than time. As David Allen likes to say "the human brain is for creating ideas, not remembering them." In this project, we built a simple application for recording and archiving our ideas (good and bad alike). Throughout the project, one of our focuses was on providing a fluid and responsive client-side interface. To this end, we relied on JavaScript and jQuery to implement snappy filtering in the browser, and localStorage to persist our wonderful ideas between sessions.

          <p>
            This project aimed to allow a user to name a bookmark with a title and save a URL link to a webpage to the DOM. Users could click the link, 'Mark as Read', and 'Remove' the bookmark from their list. Unlike, an ordered set of data elements, each containing a link to its successor (as a linked list is traditionally defined in computer programming), this app simply generates a list of links, although, they are not stored in localStorage. We chose the name 'Bomb Links' to indicate bookmarks that are considered amazing.

        <h3>Number Guesser</h3>
        <div><img class="number-guesser-image" src="./project-images/oil-in-water.jpg" alt="numbers"/></div>
          <p>
            Number Guesser is a mini-game by which your task is to guess a number between a default range of 1 and 100 that matches a computer-generated random number. If your number is too high, too low, out of the accepted range, not a valid entry (such as a letter), or equal to the computer's number, you will receive condition-specific feedback on your guess. In the case that you guess the number correctly, you win, and the program adjusts the max and min by 10, up and down respectively, to add a greater difficulty after each successful guess. You can also manually adjust the max and min, clear the input field, and reset the game. Users are also able to customize the range at their own volition.

            In this mini app, you are able to enter any word and get a live update of the Scrabble score for your word. You are able to word input and score, and save words and respective scores the the page without a refresh. This was a small app built during an assessment in Module 2 of the Front-End Engineering program at Turing: School of Software and Design. This app was built in about 30 minutes during a final assessment in Module 2.

            This mini project was aimed at doing exactly what the name implies: change some colors. This small application has two buttons, one which sets a random background color that cannot be white and another that resets the background color to white. This project highlighted focus on breaking the project down into small bite-sized steps, using good git workflows while getting to work on features adhered to comps that showing colors, fonts, and layouts for desktop and for mobile, respectively.
